# Dojo-Currencies

Dojo-Currencies is a simple application connecting to [NBP-API](http://api.nbp.pl/) for currencies exchange info.
Application allows us:
* Retrieving actual available currencies names with their currency code
* Retrieving actual exchange rates in context of Polish currency (PLN)
* Converting currencies based on exchange rates (at this moment only from PLN to available currency and vice versa)

## Requirements
To set up all the environments, it is required to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

## Installation
1. Clone repository.
2. Open terminal in project root path, example: `desktop/dojo-currencies`

4. To close all containers:

```
